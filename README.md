# PopStocks

## About

PopStocks is a mock trading platform, where artists on Spotify represent the tradable assets. You play the role of an A&R Representative with a small starting budget. Your goal is to find undiscovered talent, invest early, and build your portfolio. Grow your roster over time and use the proceeds to invest in bigger artists.

## How to Play

Sign up for an account. You'll be given $5000 in mock currency to invest with. An artist's value is calculated by finding the number of unique listeners they've had in the last 30 days, divided by 1000. Search for artists by name in the search bar, and browse their page for a host of research material. See a historical graph of their listeners over time, listen to their most popular tracks, and catch up with associated news articles. The performance of your portfolio will be reflected on the homepage, with a more detailed breakdown of your assets in the portfolio section. The homepage also features the Spotify Global TOp 50, and the most recent music and entertainment news, from sources like Complex, Rolling Stone and Pitchfork.

## Technology

PopStocks is made with [Remix](https://remix.run/), a full-stack development framework built on top of React. It uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) to fetch data from Spotify. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, using Prisma as the ORM, and the application is deployed to fly.io, made easy by fly's seamless integration with Remix.
